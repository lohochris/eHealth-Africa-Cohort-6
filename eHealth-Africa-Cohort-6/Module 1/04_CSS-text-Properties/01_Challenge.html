    <h2>Font Family Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Serif Font</h3>
    <p id="serif">
        This is a paragraph with the <strong>serif</strong> font family. Serif fonts are traditional and often used in print. 
        Each letter has small decorative lines at the end of its strokes.
    </p>

    <h3>Sans-Serif Font</h3>
    <p id="sans-serif">
        This is a paragraph with the <strong>sans-serif</strong> font family. Sans-serif fonts are modern and clean, without 
        the decorative lines seen in serif fonts.
    </p>

    <h3>Monospace Font</h3>
    <p id="monospace">
        This is a paragraph with the <strong>monospace</strong> font family. Monospace fonts make each character occupy the 
        same width, which is ideal for coding and technical documents.
    </p>

    <h3>Cursive Font</h3>
    <p id="cursive">
        This is a paragraph with the <strong>cursive</strong> font family. Cursive fonts imitate handwriting and can add a 
        creative, personal touch to the text.
    </p>

    <h3>Fantasy Font</h3>
    <p id="fantasy">
        This is a paragraph with the <strong>fantasy</strong> font family. Fantasy fonts are highly decorative and used for 
        creative, playful styles rather than readability.
    </p>
